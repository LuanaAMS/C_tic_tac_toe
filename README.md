# C | C++ - Tic Tac Toe
This project is a tic-tac-toe game made in C or C++ that uses a simple strategy to always try to beat the player.

## What is Tic-Tac-Toe?

The game is played on a 3x3 board, where two players take turns placing their symbol (X or O) in an empty cell. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

In this program, the player always plays as the symbol 'O'. However, they can choose whether or not to start. If the player chooses to start, the computer will have a more complex code. If the player chooses not to start, the code is smaller and simpler. In both cases, the computer has a higher chance of winning.

## What is the strategy?

The computer uses a simple strategy that consists of:

  - Checking if it can win on the next move. If so, making that move.
  - If it cannot win on the next move, checking if the player can win on the next move. If so, blocking that move.
  - If it cannot win or block the player on the next move, making any move that still gives it a chance to win.

## Requirements:

- IDE that supports C programs such as "Clion", "Eclipse", "NetBeans", "CÃ³digo Lite" or "Visual Studio Code" with its extensions
- Libraries "Windows.h", "stdbool.h" and "unistd.h"

## How to play:

You can access the project locally through these steps:

 - Clone the GitHub repository.
   
 - Open using your preferred IDE.

 - Execute the game.

 - Have fun!
